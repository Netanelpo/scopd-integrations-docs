# SCOPD SIEM Local Installation Guide

##  Step 1. Preparing the archive

Upload the archive to the server beforehand:
`SCOPD SIEM local install.zip`

---

##  Step 2. Connecting to the server

On your computer:

```bash
ssh -p 3024 administrator@<server-ip>
```

Connect as user `administrator`.

---

##  Step 3. Extracting the archive

On the server:

```bash
# Go to the administrator’s home folder
cd /home/administrator

# Extract the archive
unzip "SCOPD SIEM local install.zip" -d ~/scopd-siem-local-install

# Check contents
ls -l ~/scopd-siem-local-install
```

Now the folder `~/scopd-siem-local-install` contains the installation files, including `local_install.sh`.

Extraction requires the `unzip` package. If it’s missing, install it:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y unzip
```

---

##  Step 4. Running the installer

Go into the folder and run the script:

```bash
cd ~/scopd-siem-local-install
chmod +x local_install.sh
sudo ./local_install.sh
```

---

##  Step 5. Finishing installation

After the script completes, you will see:
` SCOPD SIEM successfully installed (offline).`

Now the web interface is available at:

```text
https://<server-ip>:443
```

Login credentials:

* User: `admin`
* Password: generated by the script (shown at the end of installation)
