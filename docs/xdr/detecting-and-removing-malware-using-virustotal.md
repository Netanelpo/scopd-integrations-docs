# Detecting and removing malware using Virustotal

## Ubuntu endpoint

### Agent configuration

1.) Search for the `<syscheck>` block in the agent configuration file `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`. Make sure that `<disabled>` is set to `no`. This enables monitoring for directory changes.
- Add an entry within the `<syscheck>` block to configure a directory to be monitored in near real-time. In this case, you are monitoring the `/root` directory:

```<directories realtime="yes">/root</directories>```

2.) Install `jq`, a utility that processes JSON input from the active response script.
> sudo apt update
> 
> sudo apt -y install jq

3.) Create the `/var/ossec/active-response/bin/remove-threat.sh` active response script to remove malicious files from the endpoint:
<details>
   <summary>Active response script: remove-threat (Linux)</summary>
```bash
{% include "xdr_linux_scripts/remove-threat.sh" %}
```
</details>

4.) Change the `/var/ossec/active-response/bin/remove-threat.sh` file ownership, and permissions:
> sudo chmod 750 /var/ossec/active-response/bin/remove-threat.sh
>
> sudo chown root:wazuh /var/ossec/active-response/bin/remove-threat.sh

5.) Restart the agent to apply the changes:
> sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent

### Server configuration

1.) Add the following rules to the `/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml` file on the SIEM server. These rules alert about changes in the `/root` directory that are detected by FIM scans:

<details>
   <summary>FIM rules for detecting file changes in /root</summary>

```xml
<group name="syscheck,pci_dss_11.5,nist_800_53_SI.7,">
  <!-- Rules for Linux systems -->
  <rule id="100200" level="7">
      <if_sid>550</if_sid>
      <field name="file">/root</field>
      <description>File modified in /root directory.</description>
  </rule>
  <rule id="100201" level="7">
      <if_sid>554</if_sid>
      <field name="file">/root</field>
      <description>File added to /root directory.</description>
  </rule>
</group>
```

</details>

2.) Add the following configuration to the SIEM server `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file to enable the Virustotal integration. Replace `<YOUR_VIRUS_TOTAL_API_KEY>` with your VirusTotal API key. This allows to trigger a VirusTotal query whenever any of the rules 100200 and 100201 are triggered:

<details>
   <summary>VirusTotal integration configuration (Linux)</summary>

```xml
<ossec_config>
<integration>
  <name>virustotal</name>
  <api_key>{YOUR_VIRUS_TOTAL_API_KEY}</api_key> <!-- Replace with your VirusTotal API key -->
  <rule_id>100200,100201</rule_id>
  <alert_format>json</alert_format>
</integration>
</ossec_config>
```

</details>

<details>
   <summary>Important: VirusTotal API rate limits</summary>
The free VirusTotal API rate limits requests to four per minute. If you have a premium VirusTotal API key, with a high frequency of queries allowed, you can add more rules besides these two. You can also configure SIEM to monitor more directories.
</details>

3.) Append the following blocks to the SIEM server `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file. This enables Active Response and triggers the remove-threat.sh script when VirusTotal flags a file as malicious:

<details>
   <summary>Configure Active Response to remove malicious files</summary>

```xml
<ossec_config>
    <command>
      <name>remove-threat</name>
      <executable>remove-threat.sh</executable>
      <timeout_allowed>no</timeout_allowed>
    </command>
    
    <active-response>
      <disabled>no</disabled>
      <command>remove-threat</command>
      <location>local</location>
      <rules_id>87105</rules_id>
    </active-response>
</ossec_config>
```

</details>

4.) Add the following rules to the SIEM server `/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml` file to alert about the Active Response results:

<details>
   <summary>Rules for Active Response execution results</summary>

```xml
<group name="virustotal,">
    <rule id="100092" level="12">
      <if_sid>657</if_sid>
      <match>Successfully removed threat</match>
      <description>$(parameters.program) removed threat located at $(parameters.alert.data.virustotal.source.file)</description>
    </rule>
    
    <rule id="100093" level="12">
      <if_sid>657</if_sid>
      <match>Error removing threat</match>
      <description>Error removing threat located at $(parameters.alert.data.virustotal.source.file)</description>
    </rule>
</group>
```

</details>

5.) Restart the SIEM manager to apply the configuration changes:

> sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager

### Attack emulation

1.) Download an EICAR test file to the /root directory on the Ubuntu endpoint:

> sudo curl -Lo /root/eicar.com [https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com](https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com) && sudo ls -lah /root/eicar.com

Visualize the alerts.

You can visualize the alert data in the SIEM dashboard. To do this, go to the Threat Hunting module and add the filters in the search bar to query the alerts.

## Windows endpoint
### Agent configuration

Perform the following steps to configure SIEM to monitor near real-time changes in the `/Downloads` directory. These steps also install the necessary packages and create the active response script to remove malicious files.

1.) Search for the `<syscheck>` block in the SIEM agent `C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.conf` file. Make sure that <disabled> is set to no. This enables the SIEM FIM module to monitor for directory changes.

2.) Add an entry within the `<syscheck>` block to configure a directory to be monitored in near real-time. In this use case, you configure SIEM to monitor the `C:\Users<USER_NAME>\Downloads` directory. Replace the `<USER_NAME>` variable with the appropriate user name:

```xml
<directories realtime="yes">C:\Users\{USER_NAME}\Downloads</directories>
```

3.) Download the Python executable installer from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

4.) Run the Python installer once downloaded. Make sure to check the following boxes:

* Install launcher for all users
* Add Python 3.X to PATH (This places the interpreter in the execution path)

5.) Once Python completes the installation process, open an administrator PowerShell terminal and use pip to install PyInstaller:

> pip install pyinstaller

> pyinstaller --version

You use Pyinstaller here to convert the active response Python script into an executable application that can run on a Windows endpoint.

6.) Create an active response script remove-threat.py to remove a file from the Windows endpoint:

<details>
   <summary>Warning: Proof-of-concept script</summary>
This script is a proof of concept (PoC). Review and validate it to ensure it meets the operational and security requirements of your environment.
</details>

<details>
   <summary>Active response script: remove-threat (Windows)</summary>
```python
{% include "xdr_windows_scripts/remove-threat.py" %}
```
</details>

7.) Convert the active response Python script remove-threat.py to a Windows executable application. Run the following PowerShell command as an administrator to create the executable:

> pyinstaller -F \path_to_remove-threat.py

Take note of the path where pyinstaller created remove-threat.exe.

8.) Move the executable file remove-threat.exe to the C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\active-response\bin directory.

9.) Restart the SIEM agent to apply the changes. Run the following PowerShell command as an administrator:

```powershell
> Restart-Service -Name wazuh
```

### Server configuration

Perform the following steps on the SIEM server to configure the VirusTotal integration. These steps also enable and trigger the active response script whenever a suspicious file is detected.

1.) Add the following configuration to the `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file on the SIEM server to enable the VirusTotal integration. Replace `<YOUR_VIRUS_TOTAL_API_KEY>` with your VirusTotal API key. This allows to trigger a VirusTotal query whenever any of the rules in the FIM syscheck group are triggered:

<details>
   <summary>VirusTotal integration configuration (Windows)</summary>

```xml
<ossec_config>
    <integration>
      <name>virustotal</name>
      <api_key>{YOUR_VIRUS_TOTAL_API_KEY}</api_key> <!-- Replace with your VirusTotal API key -->
      <group>syscheck</group>
      <alert_format>json</alert_format>
    </integration>
</ossec_config>
```

</details>

<details>
   <summary>Important: VirusTotal API rate limits</summary>
The free VirusTotal API rate limits requests to four per minute. If you have a premium VirusTotal API key, with a high frequency of queries allowed, you can add more rules besides these two. You can configure SIEM to monitor more directories.
</details>

2.) Append the following blocks to the SIEM server `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file. This enables Active Response and trigger the remove-threat.exe executable when the VirusTotal query returns positive matches for threats:

<details>
   <summary>Configure Active Response to execute remove-threat.exe</summary>

```xml
<ossec_config>
    <command>
      <name>remove-threat</name>
      <executable>remove-threat.exe</executable>
      <timeout_allowed>no</timeout_allowed>
    </command>
    
    <active-response>
      <disabled>no</disabled>
      <command>remove-threat</command>
      <location>local</location>
      <rules_id>87105</rules_id>
    </active-response>
</ossec_config>
```

</details>

3.) Add the following rules to the SIEM server `/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml` file to alert about the Active Response results.

<details>
   <summary>Rules for Active Response execution results</summary>

```xml
<group name="virustotal,">
    <rule id="100092" level="12">
        <if_sid>657</if_sid>
        <match>Successfully removed threat</match>
        <description>$(parameters.program) removed threat located at $(parameters.alert.data.virustotal.source.file)</description>
    </rule>
    
    <rule id="100093" level="12">
      <if_sid>657</if_sid>
      <match>Error removing threat</match>
      <description>Error removing threat located at $(parameters.alert.data.virustotal.source.file)</description>
    </rule>
</group>
```

</details>

4.) Restart the SIEM manager to apply the configuration changes:

> sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager

### Attack emulation

1.) Follow the next steps to temporarily turn off real-time Microsoft Defender antivirus protection in Windows Security:

a. Click on the Start menu and type Windows Security to search for that app.

b. Select the Windows Security app from results, go to Virus & threat protection, and under Virus & threat protection settings select Manage settings.

c. Switch Real-time protection to Off.

2.) Download an EICAR test file to the `C:\Users<USER_NAME>\Downloads` directory on the Windows endpoint.

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri [https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt](https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt) -OutFile eicar.txt
cp .\eicar.txt C:\Users<USER_NAME>\Downloads
```

This triggers a VirusTotal query and generates an alert. In addition, the active response script automatically removes the file.

You can visualize the alert data in the SIEM dashboard. To do this, go to the Threat Hunting module and add the filters in the search bar to query the alerts.
